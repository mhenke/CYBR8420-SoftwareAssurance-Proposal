## Reflection
 Our team successfully completed the project through effective division of responsibilities and collaborative effort. Damien focused on refining our Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) and backend reporting, while Nick provided essential groundwork with the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool and initial DFD drafts. Brian handled critical editing duties, and Mike maintained our documentation and organizational structure through markdown creation and workboard management. Connor contributed to the web application report, facilitated team communication, and assisted with the project summary.
The team encountered some challenges, primarily related to schedule coordination as the semester came to a close, and technical limitations prevented simultaneous editing of tool drafts. However, we successfully addressed these obstacles through regular check-ins and effective communication channels. Two productive Discord Streams proved particularly valuable, allowing for real-time collaboration and idea generation for the reports.
Moving forward, the team identified several potential improvements for future projects. These include implementing real-time collaboration tools to facilitate simultaneous editing, establishing more structured communication protocols early in the project lifecycle, and developing a more comprehensive schedule planning system to account for end-of-semester time constraints. Despite the challenges faced, our team's ability to adapt and maintain clear communication channels ensured the successful completion of all project requirements.

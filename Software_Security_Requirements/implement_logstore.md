### Use Case 5: Implementing a Logging for Service Health Monitoring
**Overview:** Configuring Keycloak to include logging and monitoring systems can be is important in order to properly maintain good system health. This includes tracking performance metrics and securing logs within a centralized log store to detect performance issues, potential security threats, or any other anomalies. Logs assist administrators with reviewing essential operational behaviors while also being able to investigate any suspicious activities.

### **Misuse Case Analysis**
#### Malicious Configuration Changes by Administrator (Insider Threat)
- **Motives**: Employee seeks to sabotage operations due to grievances with management.
- **Resources**: Legitimate access credentials, knowledge of internal systems, policies, configurations, and administrative privileges within Keycloak for modifying roles, users, and security settings.
- **Attack Methods**: Privilege abuse (misusing administrative privileges for unauthorized changes) and configuration manipulation (altering settings to disable security features or permit unauthorized access).
- **Access Level**: Full administrative access to all realms, users, roles, and security configurations.

#### Privilege Escalation through Exploitation by Employee (Insider Threat)
- **Motives**: Employee aims to misuse company data for personal projects or competitive advantage.
- **Resources**: Knowledge of system vulnerabilities (e.g., bugs, misconfigurations) and access to lower-privileged accounts to identify weaknesses.
- **Attack Methods**: Exploit vulnerabilities (leveraging system flaws to escalate privileges) and misuse of existing access (utilizing valid access to gain unauthorized privileges).
- **Access Level**: Starting with low to moderate access, with the intent to escalate to full administrative access.

#### Session Hijacking (External Attacker)
- **Motives**: Attacker aims to disrupt operations by taking over an active administrator session.
- **Resources**: Tools for intercepting network traffic (e.g., packet sniffers, malware) and knowledge of the target's operational environment and network structure.
- **Attack Methods**: Man-in-the-middle attack (capturing session tokens or cookies to impersonate the administrator) and cross-site scripting (XSS) (exploiting vulnerabilities to execute scripts in the administrator's session context).
- **Access Level**: Temporary full administrative access, enabling actions as the legitimate administrator.

#### Misuse Remedy
- Build a list of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis. 

### Reflection
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.

### Use Case 5: Implementing a Logging for Service Health Monitoring
**Overview:** Configuring Keycloak to include logging and monitoring systems is important to properly maintain good system health. This includes tracking performance metrics and securing logs within a centralized log store to detect performance issues, potential security threats, or any other anomalies. Logs assist administrators with reviewing essential operational behaviors while also being able to investigate any suspicious activities.

#### Use Case: 
Keycloak is configured to log events and system performance data to a log store. These logs track pertinent information regarding activities such as log-in attempts, server performance/health, along with any error that may be occurring in the environment.


In this scenario, the system requesting authorized access could be an application or service interacting with Keycloak, rather than an individual user. For instance, when a user attempts to log in, Keycloak verifies the credentials and issues an access token. If SSO is enabled, once the user logs in to one application, Keycloak seamlessly authorizes access to other connected applications without prompting for credentials again. Additionally, if a new device is used for access, Keycloak can trigger multi-factor authentication to ensure secure access. Throughout this process, passwords and other sensitive information should be encrypted and stored securely, ensuring that access tokens, session cookies, and credentials are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Misuse Case:
A common misuse case involves attackers attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process. For instance, an attacker might perform a session hijacking attack by intercepting session cookies or access tokens over unsecured connections. With these, they could gain unauthorized access to an active session without needing the userâ€™s credentials. Another potential attack could involve credential stuffing, where compromised user credentials from other breaches are used to attempt logins, leveraging the fact that users often reuse passwords across different platforms. In more sophisticated attacks, adversaries might try SQL injection or similar exploits to compromise the backend database storing user credentials, which could lead to mass exposure of sensitive data. Even hashed passwords can be vulnerable if weak hashing algorithms are used, making it imperative that robust cryptographic methods are employed.


#### Misuse Remedy
- Build a list of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis. 

### Reflection
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.

### Use Case 5: Implementing a Logging for Service Health Monitoring
**Overview:** Configuring Keycloak to include logging and monitoring systems is important to properly maintain good system health. This includes tracking performance metrics and securing logs within a centralized log store to detect performance issues, potential security threats, or any other anomalies. Logs assist administrators with reviewing essential operational behaviors while also being able to investigate any suspicious activities.

#### Use Case: 
A non-privileged user connects to an external server via a Keycloak authentication method. The user is able to log in to the resource successfully. With no prior knowledge relating to the security infrastructure of the method they are using to log in, the user expects their information and credentials to be properly protected and stored when logging in. This essentially means that a standard user would expect all necessary configurations in the security of the application that they are logging in with have been set up to prevent any breaches of security or information to external threats.

#### Misuse Case:
An external malicious actor attempts to breach the Keycloak infrastructure with a desire to exploit any vulnerabilities within the log store and logging mechanisms. In an attempt to gain access they are not authorized for, the actor could initially attempt to exploit any weaknesses in the logging process by attempting to remove or alter logs, therefore allowing for the removal of any events as a result of any of their actions, meaning admins would be unaware of their presence. Of those actions, gaining access to the log store could be one of them, which would allow them to intercept and possibly manipulate any data that is being transferred between the client and server, effectively performing a man-in-the-middle attack.


#### Security Requirements
- Implement session expiration policies to limi the window for session hijacking.
- Use device fingerpirintg to ensure session tokens or cookies can only be used on authorized devices
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security, especially for first-time logins or new devices.
- Utilize strong pasword hashing algorithms to protect user passwords from brute-force attacks.

### Reflection
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open-source project versus those expected by the misuse case analysis.



### Other Stuff
Keycloak is configured to log events and system performance data to a log store. These logs track pertinent information regarding activities such as log-in attempts, server performance/health, along with any error that may be occurring in the environment. Administrators are then able to access these logs to maintain system health, spot unusual patterns, and respond to potential issues swiftly. Certain thresholds can be set up to be monitored, such as driver events or login event. If a certain threshold is met when monitoring these, an alert will be configured to trigger and notify the proper team to be able to take immediate action. Additionally, sensitive information within these logs is protected through encryption and access is l restricted to authorized users, ensuring that logs are secure from any form of tampering.

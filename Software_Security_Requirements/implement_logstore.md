### Use Case 5: Implementing a Logging for Service Health Monitoring
**Overview:** Configuring Keycloak to include logging and monitoring systems is important to properly maintain good system health. This includes tracking performance metrics and securing logs within a centralized log store to detect performance issues, potential security threats, or any other anomalies. Logs assist administrators with reviewing essential operational behaviors while also being able to investigate any suspicious activities.

#### Use Case: 
A non-privileged user connects to an external server via a Keycloak authentication method. The user is able to log in to the resource successfully. With no prior knowledge relating to the security infrastructure of the method they are using to log in, the user expects their information and credentials to be properly protected and stored when logging in. This essentially means that a standard user would expect all necessary configurations in the security of the application that they are logging in with have been set up to prevent any breaches of security or information to external threats. 

#### Misuse Case:
A common misuse case involves attackers attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process. For instance, an attacker might perform a session hijacking attack by intercepting session cookies or access tokens over unsecured connections. With these, they could gain unauthorized access to an active session without needing the userâ€™s credentials. Another potential attack could involve credential stuffing, where compromised user credentials from other breaches are used to attempt logins, leveraging the fact that users often reuse passwords across different platforms. In more sophisticated attacks, adversaries might try SQL injection or similar exploits to compromise the backend database storing user credentials, which could lead to mass exposure of sensitive data. Even hashed passwords can be vulnerable if weak hashing algorithms are used, making it imperative that robust cryptographic methods are employed.


#### Misuse Remedy
- Build a list of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis. 

### Reflection
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.



### Other Stuff
Keycloak is configured to log events and system performance data to a log store. These logs track pertinent information regarding activities such as log-in attempts, server performance/health, along with any error that may be occurring in the environment. Administrators are then able to access these logs to maintain system health, spot unusual patters, and respond to potential issues swiftly. Certain thresholds can be set up to be monitored, such as driver events or login event. If a certain threshold is met when monitoring these, an alert will be configured to trigger and notify the proper team to be able to take immediate action. Additionally, sensitive information within these logs is protected through encryption and access is l restricted to authorized users, ensuring that logs are secure from any form of tampering.

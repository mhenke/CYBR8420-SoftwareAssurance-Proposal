# Software Assurance Project - CYBR8420-850 (24FA)

## Overview
This repository contains the collaborative efforts of our team for the Software Assurance class (CYBR8420-850). The primary focus of this project is to analyze an open-source software's security features and threats, within the context of a hypothetical operational environment. The project includes tasks such as threat modeling, security feature evaluation, and project planning.

## Project Structure
- **Project Proposal:** [project-proposal.md](./project-proposal.md) - Contains our project proposal outlining the open-source software selection, environment description, perceived threats, security features, and team reflection.
- **Task Assignments & Collaboration:** The GitHub Project Board is used to track internal task assignments and team collaboration. [View Project Board](https://github.com/users/mhenke/projects/3).
- **Diagram:** Systems engineering view representations of the project's operational environment are included. [Systems Engineering Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ffcd9d6-e125-4c6b-a5fc-dce287b89025)

# Code Analysis

## Introduction

Ensuring proper software assurance begins with analyzing potential attack scenarios and identifying the requirements to secure the software and validate its functionality. With these threats addressed and security measures planned, we shift our focus to source code review. This step determines whether the current code meets assurance standards or requires modifications to address security gaps. Our approach integrates automated scanning tools, manual reviews, and cross-referencing findings against identified threats and vulnerabilities.

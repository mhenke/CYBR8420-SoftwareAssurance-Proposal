#### Misuse Case Analysis
* For each use case, derive security requirements using misuse case analysis.  
    * Identify misusers with descriptive names.
        * Motives
        * Resources
        * Attack of choice
        * Access level
    * Include a simple use-misuse case diagram for each interaction.

        * Reference: Use-Misuse Case Sample.drawio (link provided)
    * Derive security requirements based on the misuse cases.
#### Security Requirements & OSS Features
- Build a list of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis. 
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.

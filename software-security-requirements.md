```
**Key Considerations for Refinement:**

1. **Motivation Analysis:**
   - Ensure the use cases reflect **user motives**, particularly for **disgruntled employees** or **impersonation scenarios**. Misuse cases should clearly link to logical attacks (e.g., credential theft or privilege escalation).

2. **Security Features Integration:**
   - Track how security features (e.g., **login, authorization, session management**) support these use cases and ensure alignment with best practices.

3. **Documentation Standards:**
   - Clean up notations, ensuring **actors**, **threats**, and **security requirements** are clearly defined and aligned with established standards.

## Part 1: Essential Interactions
### Use Case 1: Web-Based Admin Console
**Overview:** Keycloak provides a web-based Admin Console for administrators (human interaction) to manage realms, users, roles, clients, identity brokering, and other security configurations.

### **Misuse Case Analysis**

#### Malicious Configuration Changes by Administrator (Insider Threat)
Victor is a long-serving IT administrator who has grown increasingly bitter due to being overlooked for promotions. Despite his loyalty to the company, he feels neglected and wronged by management’s lack of recognition for his contributions. This frustration has turned into a vendetta, and he decides to "teach the company a lesson" by sabotaging the very systems he’s entrusted to maintain.

- **Motives**: Victor seeks to sabotage operations due to grievances with management.
- **Resources**: Victor has legitimate access credentials, knowledge of internal systems, policies, configurations, and administrative privileges within Keycloak for modifying roles, users, and security settings.
- **Attack Methods**: Victor uses privilege abuse to take advantage of his high-level access to make unauthorized changes. He modifies user roles, removes security constraints, and elevates privileges for malicious actors or himself.
- **Access Level**: Victor holds full administrative access within Keycloak. This enables him to manipulate all realms, users, roles, and security configurations, effectively giving him control over the organization’s entire authentication and authorization infrastructure.

### Reflection
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.

### Use Case 2: User Authorization

**Overview:** User authentication is a crucial aspect of any application, and Keycloak plays a vital role in this domain. As an identity and access management tool, Keycloak facilitates user authorizations and offers features like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Given its position as the gateway for numerous applications, it is imperative that user authentication is robust and secure. Ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot impersonate legitimate users is essential to safeguard not only individual applications but the entire ecosystem.

#### Diagram
*Illustrate Use Case 1.*  
![Use-Case-1](https://placehold.co/400x200/EEE/31343C)

#### Use Case: 
In this scenario, the system requesting authorized access could be an application or service interacting with Keycloak, rather than an individual user. For instance, when a user attempts to log in, Keycloak verifies the credentials and issues an access token. If SSO is enabled, once the user logs in to one application, Keycloak seamlessly authorizes access to other connected applications without prompting for credentials again. Additionally, if a new device is used for access, Keycloak can trigger multi-factor authentication to ensure secure access. Throughout this process, passwords and other sensitive information should be encrypted and stored securely, ensuring that access tokens, session cookies, and credentials are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Misuse Case:
A common misuse case involves attackers attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process. For instance, an attacker might perform a session hijacking attack by intercepting session cookies or access tokens over unsecured connections. With these, they could gain unauthorized access to an active session without needing the user’s credentials. Another potential attack could involve credential stuffing, where compromised user credentials from other breaches are used to attempt logins, leveraging the fact that users often reuse passwords across different platforms. In more sophisticated attacks, adversaries might try SQL injection or similar exploits to compromise the backend database storing user credentials, which could lead to mass exposure of sensitive data. Even hashed passwords can be vulnerable if weak hashing algorithms are used, making it imperative that robust cryptographic methods are employed.


#### Security Requirements
- Implement session expiration policies to limi the window for session hijacking.
- Use device fingerpirintg to ensure session tokens or cookies can only be used on authorized devices
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security, especially for first-time logins or new devices.
- Utilize strong pasword hashing algorithms to protect user passwords from brute-force attacks.

### Reflection
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.

# Requirements for Software Security Engineering
## Part 1: Essential Interactions
### Use Case 1: XXXXX

- **Objective:** Analyze an essential interaction involving LDAP authentication using the BIND operation. Develop simple use-case diagrams initially to outline actor-system interactions.

#### **Diagram:**

### **Misuse Case Analysis**
**Security Threats:** Identify potential threats from malicious actors (e.g., disgruntled employees or external attackers attempting impersonation).
- **Misuser Details:**
    - **Motives:** Understanding user motives such as insider threats or unauthorized access.
    - **Resources:** Identify the resources misusers might leverage (e.g., stolen credentials).
    - **Attack of Choice:** Specify types of attacks such as impersonation or brute force.
    - **Access Level:** Define the potential access misusers might achieve.

- **Misuse Diagram:**
    *Include a visual representation of the misuse case tied to this interaction.*

- **Security Requirements:** Derive security requirements aimed at countering threats.
    - **Examples:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA), rate limiting, stronger session management, and detailed audit logs.
    - **Logical Attacks:** Link requirements to logical attack vectors identified in misuse cases.

### **Security Requirements & OSS Features**
- **Alignment with Keycloak:**
    - Compare the derived security requirements with **Keycloak’s advertised features** (e.g., LDAP integration, authorization mechanisms, session management, logging).
    - **Key Considerations:**
        - Evaluate whether Keycloak’s current security features sufficiently address identified misuse cases.
        - Propose contributions or improvements where gaps are found (e.g., documentation updates, feature enhancements).

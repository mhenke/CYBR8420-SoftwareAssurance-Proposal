# Requirements for Software Security Engineering
## Part 1: Essential Interactions
### Use Case 1: XXXXX

- **Objective:** Analyze an essential interaction involving LDAP authentication using the BIND operation. Develop simple use-case diagrams initially to outline actor-system interactions.

#### **Diagram:**

### **Misuse Case Analysis**
**Security Threats:** Identify potential threats from malicious actors (e.g., disgruntled employees or external attackers attempting impersonation).
- **Misuser Details:**
    - **Motives:** Understanding user motives such as insider threats or unauthorized access.
    - **Resources:** Identify the resources misusers might leverage (e.g., stolen credentials).
    - **Attack of Choice:** Specify types of attacks such as impersonation or brute force.
    - **Access Level:** Define the potential access misusers might achieve.

- **Misuse Diagram:**
    *Include a visual representation of the misuse case tied to this interaction.*

### Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. 
- Build a list of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis. 
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.

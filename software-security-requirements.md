#### Misuse Case
Malicious Configuration Changes by Administrator (Insider Threat)

Victor is a long-serving IT administrator who has grown increasingly bitter due to being overlooked for promotions. Despite his loyalty to the company, he feels neglected and wronged by management’s lack of recognition for his contributions. This frustration has turned into a vendetta, and he decides to "teach the company a lesson" by sabotaging the very systems he’s entrusted to maintain.

- **Motives**: Victor seeks to sabotage operations due to grievances with management.
- **Resources**: Victor has legitimate access credentials, knowledge of internal systems, policies, configurations, and administrative privileges within Keycloak for modifying roles, users, and security settings.
- **Attack Methods**: Victor uses privilege abuse to take advantage of his high-level access to make unauthorized changes. He modifies user roles, removes security constraints, and elevates privileges for malicious actors or himself.
- **Access Level**: Victor holds full administrative access within Keycloak. This enables him to manipulate all realms, users, roles, and security configurations, effectively giving him control over the organization’s entire authentication and authorization infrastructure.

#### Security Requirements
- Implement Immutable Audit Logs.
- Establish Change Approval Workflows.
- Conduct Regular Security Audits.
- Implement Continuous Monitoring and Alerts.

#### Reflection

Keycloak offers robust authentication and authorization capabilities, but its security effectiveness hinges on proper implementation. The misuse case analysis highlights key security requirements that organizations must address. Keycloak includes built-in audit logging for administrative actions, which is essential for tracking changes and detecting misuse. However, organizations should implement immutable audit logs to enhance log security and integrity. 

Additionally, while Keycloak provides role-based access control (RBAC), it lacks built-in approval workflows for administrative changes; thus, organizations need to establish change approval workflows to mitigate unauthorized modifications. To support comprehensive threat detection, organizations should implement continuous monitoring and alerts to identify suspicious activities effectively.

### Use Case 2: User Authorization

#### Overview 
User authentication is a crucial aspect of any application, and Keycloak plays a vital role in this domain. As an identity and access management tool, Keycloak facilitates user authorizations and offers features like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Given its position as the gateway for numerous applications, it is imperative that user authentication is robust and secure. Ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot impersonate legitimate users is essential to safeguard not only individual applications but the entire ecosystem.

#### Use Case
In this scenario, the system requesting authorized access could be an application or service interacting with Keycloak, rather than an individual user. For instance, when a user attempts to log in, Keycloak verifies the credentials and issues an access token. If SSO is enabled, once the user logs in to one application, Keycloak seamlessly authorizes access to other connected applications without prompting for credentials again. Additionally, if a new device is used for access, Keycloak can trigger multi-factor authentication to ensure secure access. Throughout this process, passwords and other sensitive information should be encrypted and stored securely, ensuring that access tokens, session cookies, and credentials are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Use Case Diagram
![Use-Case-1](https://placehold.co/400x200/EEE/31343C)

#### Misuse Case
A common misuse case involves attackers attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process. For instance, an attacker might perform a session hijacking attack by intercepting session cookies or access tokens over unsecured connections. With these, they could gain unauthorized access to an active session without needing the user’s credentials. Another potential attack could involve credential stuffing, where compromised user credentials from other breaches are used to attempt logins, leveraging the fact that users often reuse passwords across different platforms. In more sophisticated attacks, adversaries might try SQL injection or similar exploits to compromise the backend database storing user credentials, which could lead to mass exposure of sensitive data. Even hashed passwords can be vulnerable if weak hashing algorithms are used, making it imperative that robust cryptographic methods are employed.

#### Misuse Case Diagram

#### Security Requirements
- Implement session expiration policies to limi the window for session hijacking.
- Use device fingerpirintg to ensure session tokens or cookies can only be used on authorized devices
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security, especially for first-time logins or new devices.
- Utilize strong pasword hashing algorithms to protect user passwords from brute-force attacks.

#### Reflection
- Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings, reflecting on the sufficiency of security features offered by the open source project versus those expected by the mis use case analysis.

### Use Case 4: Role and Permission Requests

#### Overview
In identity and access management systems like Keycloak, handling roles and permission requests is critical for controlling user access within applications. Keycloak’s role-based access control (RBAC) system allows administrators to define roles and associate them with specific permissions, ensuring that users have appropriate levels of access based on their roles. Permissions can be applied at various levels, such as access to specific resources or the ability to perform certain actions within an application. By leveraging these features, applications can enforce fine-grained access control, minimizing security risks and ensuring that users only access the data and actions for which they are authorized.

#### Use Case
In this scenario, when a user requests access to a resource, the application interacts with Keycloak to confirm whether the user holds the necessary permissions. Keycloak evaluates the user’s assigned roles and compares them with the permissions tied to the requested resource. If the user possesses sufficient privileges, access is granted. In Keycloak, roles can be defined at both the realm level (applicable across all applications) and the client level (specific to individual applications).

#### Use Case Diagram

![Use-Case-1](https://placehold.co/400x200/EEE/31343C)

#### Misuse Case
Eve is a regular employee with the "User" role, giving her access to general information but barring her from sensitive resources or administrative actions. Eve is dissatisfied with the way other employees treat her and seeks to gain unauthorized privileges to view other employee's personal information. Eve attempts to exploit a misconfigured role that grants higher privileges than intended. She discovers an "Editor" role that was mistakenly given access to system settings and administrative tools. By escalating her privileges to this improperly secured role, Eve could manipulate the application in ways that go far beyond her legitimate permissions, threatening system integrity.

#### Misuse Case Diagram
*Illustrate Use Case 1.*  
![Use-Case-1](https://placehold.co/400x200/EEE/31343C)

#### Security Requirements
- Implement the principle of least privilege by ensuring that roles are granted only the minimum permissions necessary.
- Regularly audit and update role assignments to ensure they align with current business needs and employee functions.
- Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to limit access to sensitive resources.
- Use cryptographic token signing to prevent tampering of role and permission information within tokens.
- Apply logging and monitoring to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts based on roles and permissions.

#### Reflection
After assessing Keycloak's role and permission management capabilities, it's evident that the platform offers a solid foundation for access control via RBAC. Keycloak's support for both realm-level and client-level roles provides flexibility in assigning and managing permissions across various applications. However, being an open-source tool, Keycloak demands careful configuration and routine audits to maintain security best practices. A review of Keycloak's documentation highlights its robust support for token-based authentication and cryptographic safeguards. Nevertheless, organizations must enforce strict role definitions and continuously review permission settings to minimize the risk of privilege escalation.

### Use Case 5: Implementing a Logging for Service Health Monitoring
#### Overview
Configuring Keycloak to include logging and monitoring systems is important to properly maintain good system health. This includes tracking performance metrics and securing logs within a centralized log store to detect performance issues, potential security threats, or any other anomalies. Logs assist administrators with reviewing essential operational behaviors while also being able to investigate any suspicious activities.

#### Use Case
A non-privileged user connects to an external server via a Keycloak authentication method. The user is able to log in to the resource successfully. With no prior knowledge relating to the security infrastructure of the method they are using to log in, the user expects their information and credentials to be properly protected and stored when logging in. This essentially means that a standard user would expect all necessary configurations in the security of the application that they are logging in with have been set up to prevent any breaches of security or information to external threats. 

#### Use Case Diagram
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c017f4a-fd8b-4333-9636-54aa215b1981)


#### Misuse Case
An external malicious actor attempts to breach the Keycloak infrastructure with a desire to exploit any vulnerabilities within the log store and logging mechanisms. In an attempt to gain access they are not authorized for, the actor could initially attempt to exploit any weaknesses in the logging process by removing or altering logs, therefore allowing for the removal of any events as a result of any of their actions, meaning admins would be unaware of their presence. Of those actions, gaining access to the log store could be one of them, which would allow them to intercept and possibly manipulate any data that is being transferred between the client and server, effectively performing a man-in-the-middle attack.

#### Misuse Case Diagram
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3b16b6c-ccaf-4aed-91a3-0e1dda641e57)


#### Security Requirements
- Ensure all access to the log store and logging system is logged with alerts configured for suspicious activities like log deletions or modifications.
- Procedure for revoking compromised certificates and regularly auditing valid trusted certificates.
- Implement a robust security policy for the log store with MFA or a better password policy.
- Utilize digital signatures or checksums within each log entry to verify its integrity along with encryption for each entry.
- Implement TLS/SSL to encrypt data transmissions.

#### Reflection
Keycloak's logging system captures important information on server health, authentication attempts, and user activities. While these logs are essential for maintaining and managing a Keycloak environment, inadequate security controls can expose them to potential abuse by attackers. To mitigate this risk, proper security measures must be implemented to protect logs from unauthorized access or tampering. Additionally, auditing and alert systems should be configured to detect anomalies, ensuring any suspicious activity is flagged and addressed before it impacts Keycloak or connected systems.

## Project Task Assignment and Collaboration
Show your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task in a Github Project Board. 
- **Github Project Board Link**: [Insert link here]
- **Individual Contributions**: 
- **Team Reflection**:
One of the main challenges we faced was identifying the five key interactions. Initially, our approach was for each member to independently explore multiple use and misuse cases related to their specific topic and report back to avoid duplication. However, we found it difficult to narrow down the scope and pinpoint the most critical interactions that aligned with the assignment's requirements. Our group may have been overly ambitious at first, attempting to cover 80% of our operational environment rather than focusing on four or five highly relevant cases that would do the same. Additionally, because Keycloak primarily serves as an authentication tool for applications, it was challenging to distinguish five distinct cases without overlap. After dedicating time to research material online and holding mutliple team meetings, we were able to identify the most essential cases for our operational needs, which allowed the team to focus on developing them further. Our group didn’t make significant changes to our workflow moving forward, as we tend to over-prepare initially and then refine our work to make it more concise and accurate. We’ve been meeting 2-3 times a week, which has been effective in addressing any questions or issues well ahead of deadlines.

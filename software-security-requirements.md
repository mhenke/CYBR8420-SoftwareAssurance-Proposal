#### Misuse Case Analysis
* Derive security requirements using misuse case analysis.
    * Identify misusers with descriptive names.
        * Motives
        * Resources
        * Attack of choice
        * Access level
    * Include a simple use-misuse case diagram for each interaction.
        * Reference: Use-Misuse Case Sample.drawio (link provided)
    * Derive security requirements based on the misuse cases.

#### Misuse Remedy:

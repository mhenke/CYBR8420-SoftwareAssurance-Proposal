```
**Key Considerations for Refinement:**

1. **Motivation Analysis:**
   - Ensure the use cases reflect **user motives**, particularly for **disgruntled employees** or **impersonation scenarios**. Misuse cases should clearly link to logical attacks (e.g., credential theft or privilege escalation).

2. **Security Features Integration:**
   - Track how security features (e.g., **login, authorization, session management**) support these use cases and ensure alignment with best practices.

3. **Documentation Standards:**
   - Clean up notations, ensuring **actors**, **threats**, and **security requirements** are clearly defined and aligned with established standards.

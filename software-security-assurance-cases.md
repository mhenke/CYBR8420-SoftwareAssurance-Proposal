### Assurance Case 2:  Keycloak minimizes undetected changes to administrative operations
![image](/Assurance_Cases/web_console/%20undetected-changes%20.png)

Keycloak's security framework is designed to minimize undetected changes to administrative operations through strong authentication, comprehensive audit logging, and strict authorization controls.

E1: Penetration testing results for authentication system

E2: Log integrity checks and access controls
Keycloak provides comprehensive audit logging capabilities for both user and admin events. The system allows configuration of which events to save and for how long in the Keycloak Admin Console8

E3: Code review findings for access control implementation
While Keycloak is an open-source project with its code available for review, there's no public documentation of formal code review findings specifically for access control implementation. This represents a gap in the evidence. However, the project's active development and community involvement suggest ongoing code review processes.

Conclusion and Gaps: After review of Keycloak documentation, the following partial gap and observations were identified:

- Strong authentication mechanisms (C2):
    Keycloak provides robust [authentication features](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#configuring-authentication_server_administration_guide), including multi-factor authentication, social login, and customizable password policies. - No Gap
- Comprehensive audit logging (C3):
    Keycloak offers extensive auditing capabilities for both user and [admin events](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#auditing-admin-events_).
    Partial Gap: While audit logging is comprehensive, there's no explicit mention of log integrity checks (E2) in the available documentation.
- Proper authorization controls (C4):
    Keycloak implements fine-grained authorization policies for [admin permissions](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_admin_permissions) - No Gap

## Part 2

### Alignment of Evidence

#### Assurance Case 5:

Keycloak itsellf shows an ongoing, regular interaction between the open source community and updates with clear notation on update coverage.  Keycloak provides detailed documentation on client certificate authentication and configurations regarding user identity mapping, which helps ensure that unauthorized users do not gain access to IDP configurations.  Documentation available also highlights specific vulnerabilities, such as a privilege escalation flaw in the token exchange feature and patching details for effected versions.  This documentation provides solid evidence about security patches and vulnerability handling in Keycloak.  However, there are some gaps.  For example, Keycloak mentions support for data protection features, including access control and user federation settings, but additional documentation would be needed to show explicit measures regarding GDPR security requirements.  Specific tests or audits may also be needed to prove Keycloakâ€™s compliance with privacy and security laws.  Also, while the documentation covers authentication and access control, additional steps like security audits or code reviews would help collect robust evidence on preventing unauthorized access, specifically to identify provider configuration settings.

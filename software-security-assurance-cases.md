### Assurance Case 1: Encrypted Credentials During Transit
**Assurance Case:** SSL Implementation Minimizes Man-in-the-Middle Attack

Keycloak allows for integration between multiple platforms, which commonly require credentials to be passed between endpoints. Credential theft through network eavesdropping is a risk that can be mitigated using a properly configured truststore. A truststore that enables encrypted SSL connections would greatly assist in protecting user credentials.

E1: System configuration enforces strong encryption protocols, effectively ensuring that any communication using the truststore is secure. This allows for regular auditing of system logs at it is essential to protect the integrity of the truststore. A compromised truststore undermines the reliability of SSL connections, potentially allowing rogue entities to impersonate endpoints and gather user credentials.

E2: Logs and monitoring confirm that invalid certificates are rejected. Using SSL certificates with weak encryption can facilitate credential interception; thus, SSL certificates must be acquired from trusted Certificate Authorities, adhering to industry-standard RSA 2048-bit or higher key lengths.

E3: Real-time certificate status-checking mechanisms are in place to ensure that only valid and current certificates are used, further safeguarding against unauthorized access.

E4: Configuration files and system policies enforce key management rules ensure that cryptographic keys are handled securely and comply with best practices.

E5: Legacy system upgrade documentation or security policies enforcing the restriction, ensuring the implementation is up to date with the most recent security updates that are provided.

Conclusion and Gaps: Implementing a truststore significantly enhances the security of a Keycloak instance, effectively eliminating man-in-the-middle attacks. The simplicity of adding a truststore means the potential for gaps is minimal, with none detected in this case. SSL handshakes are binary, established only if both parties agree. The key consideration is to utilize a high-bit certificate issued by a trusted authority, easily verifiable through modern browsers that warn against weak or untrusted certificates. Additional responsibilities fall on the Keycloak administrator to regularly audit changes to the truststore.

### Assurance Case 2:  Keycloak minimizes undetected changes to administrative operations
![image](/Assurance_Cases/web_console/%20undetected-changes%20.png)

Keycloak's security framework is designed to minimize undetected changes to administrative operations through strong authentication, comprehensive audit logging, and strict authorization controls.

E1: Penetration testing results for authentication system

E2: Log integrity checks and access controls
Keycloak provides comprehensive audit logging capabilities for both user and admin events. The system allows configuration of which events to save and for how long in the Keycloak Admin Console8

E3: Code review findings for access control implementation
While Keycloak is an open-source project with its code available for review, there's no public documentation of formal code review findings specifically for access control implementation. This represents a gap in the evidence. However, the project's active development and community involvement suggest ongoing code review processes.

Conclusion and Gaps: After review of Keycloak documentation, the following partial gap and observations were identified:

- Strong authentication mechanisms (C2):
    Keycloak provides robust [authentication features](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#configuring-authentication_server_administration_guide), including multi-factor authentication, social login, and customizable password policies. - No Gap
- Comprehensive audit logging (C3):
    Keycloak offers extensive auditing capabilities for both user and [admin events](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#auditing-admin-events_).
    Partial Gap: While audit logging is comprehensive, there's no explicit mention of log integrity checks (E2) in the available documentation. - Partial Gap
- Proper authorization controls (C4):
    Keycloak implements fine-grained authorization policies for [admin permissions](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_admin_permissions) - No Gap

## Part 2

### Alignment of Evidence

#### Assurance Case 5:

Keycloak itsellf shows an ongoing, regular interaction between the open source community and updates with clear notation on update coverage.  Keycloak provides detailed documentation on client certificate authentication and configurations regarding user identity mapping, which helps ensure that unauthorized users do not gain access to IDP configurations.  Documentation available also highlights specific vulnerabilities, such as a privilege escalation flaw in the token exchange feature and patching details for effected versions.  This documentation provides solid evidence about security patches and vulnerability handling in Keycloak.  However, there are some gaps.  For example, Keycloak mentions support for data protection features, including access control and user federation settings, but additional documentation would be needed to show explicit measures regarding GDPR security requirements.  Specific tests or audits may also be needed to prove Keycloakâ€™s compliance with privacy and security laws.  Also, while the documentation covers authentication and access control, additional steps like security audits or code reviews would help collect robust evidence on preventing unauthorized access, specifically to identify provider configuration settings.

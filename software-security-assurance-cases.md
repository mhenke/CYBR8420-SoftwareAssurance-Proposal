Keycloak allows for integration between multiple platforms, which commonly require credentials to be passed between endpoints. Credential theft through network eavesdropping is a risk that can be mitigated using a properly configured truststore. A truststore that enables encrypted SSL connections would greatly assist in protecting user credentials.

E1: System configuration enforces strong encryption protocols, effectively ensuring that any communication using the truststore is secure. This allows for regular auditing of system logs at it is essential to protect the integrity of the truststore. A compromised truststore undermines the reliability of SSL connections, potentially allowing rogue entities to impersonate endpoints and gather user credentials.

E2: Logs and monitoring confirm that invalid certificates are rejected. Using SSL certificates with weak encryption can facilitate credential interception; thus, SSL certificates must be acquired from trusted Certificate Authorities, adhering to industry-standard RSA 2048-bit or higher key lengths.

E3: Real-time certificate status-checking mechanisms are in place to ensure that only valid and current certificates are used, further safeguarding against unauthorized access.

E4: Configuration files and system policies enforce key management rules ensure that cryptographic keys are handled securely and comply with best practices.

E5: Legacy system upgrade documentation or security policies enforcing the restriction, ensuring the implementation is up to date with the most recent security standards and updates that are provided.

Conclusion and Gaps: Implementing a truststore significantly enhances the security of a Keycloak instance, effectively eliminating man-in-the-middle attacks. The simplicity of adding a truststore means the potential for gaps is minimal, with none detected in this case. SSL handshakes are binary, established only if both parties agree. The key consideration is to utilize a high-bit certificate issued by a trusted authority, easily verifiable through modern browsers that warn against weak or untrusted certificates. Additional responsibilities fall on the Keycloak administrator to regularly audit changes to the truststore.

### Assurance Case 2:  Keycloak minimizes undetected changes to administrative operations
![image](/Assurance_Cases/web_console/undetected-changes.png)

Keycloak's security framework is designed to minimize undetected changes to administrative operations through strong authentication, comprehensive audit logging, and strict authorization controls.

E1: Dynamic Application Security Testing
This evidence relates to testing the authentication system for vulnerabilities through active probing and analysis of the system while it's running. 

E2: Static Application Security Testing
This involves analyzing the source code or compiled version of the authentication system without executing it, to find potential security vulnerabilities. 

E3: Log integrity checks and access controls
This evidence pertains to the audit logging system, ensuring that logs cannot be tampered with and that access to logs is properly controlled. 

E4: Documentation on master realm access control mechanisms

E5: Configuration of dedicated realm admin consoles

E6: Implementation of fine-grained admin permissions

The above three pieces of evidence relate to the authorization controls in Keycloak, specifically how access is managed for administrative operations across different realms and with granular permissions.

Conclusion and Gaps: After review of Keycloak documentation, the following partial gaps and observations were identified:

- Strong authentication mechanisms (C2):
    Keycloak provides robust [authentication features](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#configuring-authentication_server_administration_guide), including multi-factor authentication, social login, and customizable password policies. Evidence E1 (Dynamic Application Security Testing) and E2 (Static Application Security Testing) are not explicitly mentioned in Keycloak's documentation, representing a potential gap in publicly available security assurance information. - Partial Gap
- Comprehensive audit logging (C3):
    Keycloak offers extensive auditing capabilities for both user and [admin events](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#auditing-admin-events_). While audit logging is comprehensive, there's no explicit mention of log integrity checks (E2) in the available documentation. - Partial Gap
- Proper authorization controls (C4):
    Keycloak implements fine-grained authorization policies for [admin permissions](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_admin_permissions) - No Gap

 Overall, while Keycloak provides robust security features that align with the claim of minimizing undetected changes to administrative operations, there are some gaps in the publicly available evidence, particularly regarding security testing results and log integrity checks.

### Assurance Case 3: Keycloak Diminishes Database Misuse
![image](/Assurance_Cases/web_console/CFfinal1.png)

Keycloak uses databases for various reasons, necessitating vigorous measures to prevent database misuse. This includes everything from input validation to securely hashed passwords, protecting against all types of potential attacks.

E1: The Protection API is instrumental in encrypting and securely transmitting protected data. Keycloak uses the Protection API to secure OAuth2 tokens, ensuring they are encrypted and safely transmitted between the client and server.  Keycloak employs input validation mechanisms to sanitize and validate data before processing, mitigating injection attacks. This evidence correlates to Assurance Case 1.

E2: The Policy Information Point (PIP) in Keycloak’s architecture plays a crucial role in auditing all events occurring within Keycloak. This evidence is directly related to Assurance Case 2 E3.

E3: This evidence is directly related in Assurance Case 5. Passwords are stored quite safely in a hashed format utilizing a strong hashing algorithm (PBKDF2) with a default of 27,500 hashing iterations per hashed password.  

Conclusion and Gaps: While Keycloak does mitigate database misuse effectively, it’s reliance on databases isn’t as frequent as one might think. So while the mechanisms are in place, they aren’t constantly being utilized, which would gives the user a false sense of security.
Secondly, the protection API is crucial for data encryption and transmission, ensuring that sensitive information is protected when it travels between clients and servers. However, the Protection API primarily employs BASE64 encoding for data encryption. While BASE64 helps in encoding the data, it's not an encryption method on its own. This makes it more susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept the data and potentially decode it if additional security layers aren't in place. Some suggestions for improving the gaps would be to move towards AES-256 protocols for stronger encryption, make sure strong transport layer security exists with all data transmissions, ensure the Protection API integrates with RBAC policies, and implement a strict security audit and update schedule for databases.

### Assurance Case 4:  Single Sign-On (SSO) Implementation Minimizes Session Hijacking 
![image](/Assurance_Cases/web_console/AssuranceCaseDR.png)

Keycloak allows for integration of SSO which allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without re-authenticating. SSO mechanisms protect against attacks such as session hijacking, replay attacks, and unauthorized access across integrated services. 

E1: Security audit logs can confirm that TLS/SSL is enforced for all communication between clients. These logs document that encryption is consistently applied during token transmission, ensuring that session tokens are can't be obtained by unauthorized entities. Additionally, security audits verify that TLS/SSL configurations are up-to-date and compliant with industry standards, further reducing the risk of session hijacking through network eavesdropping. 

E2: Session management logs demonstrate that session tokens have short expiration times and that token revocation mechanisms are in place. These logs include timestamps of session terminations, confirming that tokens are invalidated as soon as user logs out or when a session expires. Additionally, the system monitors to prevent attackers from exploiting stolen tokens for unauthorized reuse.

E3: OAuth 2.0 implementation outlines the use of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) which ensure tokens are securely exchanged between clients and servers. It highlights the mechanisms that prevent code interceptions and misuse during the authorization process. 

Conclusion and Gaps: Keycloak's SSO implementation minimizes session hijacking by enforcing multiple mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with toke interception, reuse, and misuse. However, some gaps remain such as the need for improved cross application token manaagement,s real-time monitoring for suspicious token activity, timely token revocation across systems, and securing client-side token storage. Address these gaps would further enhancse Keycloak's overall ability to defend against session hijacking attacks.

Keycloak provides a means for user federation via integrating with external Identity Providers or IDPs, but the connection can only be as secure as the configuration or settings.  Minimizing the unauthorized access to IDP configuration settings strengthens the security of Keycloak and the data it protects.

E1: Configuration guides, role reviews, penetration test results, and regular audits help to catch and prevent unauthorized access via misconfigurations

E2: Vulnerability scan reports, bug bounty programs, and regular system updates help stay on top of privilege escalation exploits

E3: Role configuration reviews, documentation on default role adjustments, and security audits focusing on privilege reviews ensures default roles are aligned with best practices and business needs

E4: Historical validation logs, testing tool error rates, and review processes can reduce or eliminate false positives in detection

E5: Configuration automation tool documentation, proof of deployment of automated checks, and continuous integration system configurations reduces or eliminates the margin of possible human error

E6: Configuration testing reports, tool outputs, and test coverage statistics ensure detection mechanisms cover all possible error scenarios

E7: Audit reports, testing tool outputs, and configuration checks reduces the possible misconfiguration of security protocols

E8: Service level agreements, third-party security certifications, and audit reports from external providers reduces the risk of being exposed to the vulnerabilities of external IDPs

E9: Key rotation logs, automation tool outputs, and cryptography audit reports reduces the vulnerability of communication channels and ensures they stay secure

E10: Version logs and security documentation from Keycloak demonstrates the software is updated regularly and security issues are addressed and documented

E11: Keycloak's documentation on RBAC and SBAC ensures access rights are granted based on user roles to reduce privilege escalation risks

E12: Keycloak's documentation on its logging and audit features reduces the risk of insider threats by tracking user activities and allowing for real time monitoring and detection of potential insider threats


Conclusions and Gaps:  Keycloak itsellf shows an ongoing, regular interaction between the open source community and updates with clear notation on update coverage.  Keycloak provides detailed documentation on client certificate authentication and configurations regarding user identity mapping, which helps ensure that unauthorized users do not gain access to IDP configurations.  Documentation available also highlights specific vulnerabilities, such as a privilege escalation flaw in the token exchange feature and patching details for effected versions.  Overall, this documentation provides solid evidence about security patches and vulnerability handling in Keycloak.  However, there are some gaps.  For example, Keycloak mentions support for data protection features, including access control and user federation settings, but additional documentation would be needed to show explicit measures regarding GDPR security requirements.  Specific tests or audits may also be needed to prove Keycloak’s compliance with privacy and security laws.  Also, while the documentation covers authentication and access control, additional steps like security audits or code reviews would help collect robust evidence on preventing unauthorized access, specifically to identify provider configuration settings.

### Reflection on work:
The team has started to gel well, and our communication in Discord has been effective. However, we fell short with maintaining our team meeting schedule after our Wednesday Dr. Gandhi meeting along with our typical Friday and Sunday evening meetings. Despite this, we each shared our top-level claims in Discord prior to the Wednesday meeting, which helped us prepare. After the meeting with the professor, we were able to reassess and refine our top-level claims for the project. Following this, each team member took responsibility for a specific claim, created a corresponding diagram, and identified gaps between the claims and the features offered by Keycloak. We also made improvements in our use of a markdown assignment template, ensuring better organization and structure in our submission.
